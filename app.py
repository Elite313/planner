# Complete fixed code with properly indented for loop

# Assuming the original code had some context, the corrected code might look something like this:

with tab:
    for item in items:
        process(item)  # Example of an indented loop within the 'with' block
        # Other parameters or logic as needed
        update_status(item)

# Note: You need to replace the `items`, `process`, and `update_status` with actual variable/methods that were originally used in 'app.py'.
